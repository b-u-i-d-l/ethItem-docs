# The Ecosystem of ITEMS on top of ETHEREUM

ETHITEM is a platform for building Items, a new class of objects on top of Ethereum. Fusing ERC20s, ERC721s and ERC1155s into a single superstandard, Items unleash the true power of art, games, dApps and DeFi.

# Use ITEMs EVERYWHERE  

ETHITEMS are portable across and interoperable with the entire Ethereum universe. Imagine buying potions for the next Raid in your favourite ETH-based game, or earning DAI by borrowing other in-game Items, or farming Cryptovoxel items, or...

# CREATE 

Create your own Item collections. Set owners (wallets and contracts able to mint Items) for each, and program extensions for every individual Item, making them truly portable.

# WRAP 

Wrap any ERC20, ERC721 or ERC1155 into an Item, empowering it with the qualities of all. Save gas Batch-Swapping ERC20s, farm and use ERC1155s in DeFi dApps, swap ERC721s on Uniswap—a world of possibilities awaits you.

# DeFi NFTs  

DeFi lovers can finally swap NFTs and collectibles, farm any object, arbitrage them via DeFi dApps as well as NFT stores, and more—at long last, the NFT and ERC20 ecosystems have been merged into one.
EXPLORE Explore, swap, arbitrage, bid for and track prices of all existing ethItems.

# FARM 

Farm and setup farming contracts for your Items, with full DeFi integration.

# BUIDL  

Every Item is built with extendible contracts; you can undergird them with complex technology. This is the first general-purpose, interoperable and programmable token standard. With ethItem, you can call all existing Items via proxy contracts, without needing to hardcode every address.

# ITEM the Programmable Equity of the ETHITEM DFO  

ETHITEM protocol is built on top of a Decentralized Flexible Organization (DFO), ruled 100% on-chain—without the need for any offchain intermediary—by holders of its programmable equity, ARTE.
